# sling9-to-sling12-explore

exploring to write a script converting the peregrine sling9 code base to our target peregrine sling12 code base

to use this project: 

- checkout peregrine-cms and this project into the same folder
- `cd sling9-to-sling12-explore`
- `npm install`
- `npm run converter`

this should create a new folder in `..` named `peregrine-cms-sling12` with a
project that can be built and run against the latest sling code base
